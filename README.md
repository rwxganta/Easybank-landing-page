## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

* First time using SCSS and I'm already loving the idea of separating files to each section.


### Continued development

I find myself having some problems while trying to menage the background-image, since has been awhile I have touch that area of css. Definitely need some review on background-image.
